It cannot be appeased. If we do not hit them where it hurts, we will not be able to stop this tiger growing more and more ferocious.” Mr Sheerman was part of a delegation that went to Hong Kong in the 1990s to urge its people to believe that Beijing would stick to its promises on “one country, two systems”.
